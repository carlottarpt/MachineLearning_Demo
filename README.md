# Machine Learning Coding Overview

## Summary

This notebook demonstrates various machine learning techniques, including:

1. **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**: Loading and cleaning, balancing and preparing data for modeling as well as dimensionality reduction, visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
2. **Model Building and Training**: Creating and training machine learning models and classifiers, such as linear regression, clustering algorithms, decision trees, SVMs, and ensemble methods such as random forest, boosting and bagging.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC and confusion matrices.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters to improve performance using grid-search and cross validation.
5. **Prediction and Interpretation**: Making predictions with the fitted models and interpreting the results.
